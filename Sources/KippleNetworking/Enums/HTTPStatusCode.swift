/// A list of standard HTTP response status codes.
///
/// All HTTP response status codes are separated into five classes (or categories).
/// The first digit of the status code defines the class of response.
/// The last two digits do not have any class or categorization role.
///
/// The five categories are:
/// - 1xx (Informational): The request was received and understood.
/// - 2xx (Success): The action requested by the client was received, understood and accepted.
/// - 3xx (Redirection): The client must take additional action to complete the request.
/// - 4xx (Client Error): The error seems to have been caused by the client.
/// - 5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill a request.
